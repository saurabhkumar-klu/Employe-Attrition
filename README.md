## üìà Evaluation Metrics

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.85     | 0.83      | 0.78   | 0.80     | 0.88    |
| Random Forest       | 0.87     | 0.85      | 0.80   | 0.82     | 0.90    |
| XGBoost             | 0.88     | 0.86      | 0.82   | 0.84     | 0.91    |

*Note: Metrics are based on a test dataset split of 80/20.*

## üìä Insights

* **High Attrition Factors:** Employees with low job satisfaction, high overtime, and low monthly income are more likely to leave.
* **Important Features:** Job role, years at company, and environment satisfaction significantly influence attrition.
* **Model Performance:** XGBoost outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and recall.
